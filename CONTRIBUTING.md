# Contributing to SmartCloudOps AI

We love your input! We want to make contributing to SmartCloudOps AI as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## üöÄ Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Stable releases, production-ready code
- `dev` - Development integration branch

### **Phase 3** - ML Anomaly Detection (Next)
- [ ] Implement Isolation Forest algorithm
- [ ] Create data pipeline from Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Model training and validation scripts
- [ ] Real-time inference engine

### **Phase 4** - Auto-Remediation (Upcoming)

## üé® Coding Standards

### Python (Flask App)
```python
# Use Black for formatting
black app/

# Follow PEP 8
# Use type hints
def process_query(query: str) -> dict:
    """Process a ChatOps query and return response."""
    return {"response": f"Processed: {query}"}

# Use docstrings
def anomaly_detection(metrics: list) -> bool:
    """
    Detect anomalies in system metrics.
    
    Args:
        metrics: List of metric values
        
    Returns:
        True if anomaly detected, False otherwise
    """
    pass
```

### Terraform (Infrastructure)
```hcl
# Use consistent naming
resource "aws_instance" "monitoring" {
  # Use variables for configuration
  instance_type = var.ec2_instance_type
  
  # Always add tags
  tags = {
    Name = "${var.project_name}-monitoring"
    Type = "monitoring"
  }
}

# Comment complex logic
# Security group for monitoring instance
# Allows Grafana (3000) and Prometheus (9090) access
resource "aws_security_group" "monitoring" {
  # Configuration here
}
```

### Documentation
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic

## üêõ Bug Reports

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
```python
# tests/test_app.py
import pytest
from app.main import app

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    app.config['TESTING'] = True
    with app.test_client() as client:
        yield client

def test_health_endpoint(client):
    """Test health check endpoint."""
    response = client.get('/health')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert b'healthy' in response.data
```

### Integration Tests
```python
# tests/test_integration.py
def test_prometheus_metrics():
    """Test Prometheus metrics collection."""
    # Test actual metrics endpoint
    pass

def test_s3_connectivity():
    """Test S3 bucket access."""
    # Test actual S3 operations
    pass
```

### Infrastructure Tests
```bash
# Test Terraform deployment
terraform plan -out=test.plan
terraform apply test.plan
# Run validation tests
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

## üîí Security Guidelines

### Reporting Security Issues
- **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- Email security issues to: security@smartcloudops-ai.com
- Include detailed steps to reproduce
- Allow us 90 days to address before public disclosure

### Security Best Practices
```python
# Never commit secrets
# Use environment variables
import os
api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Validate inputs
def sanitize_query(query: str) -> str:
    """Sanitize user input to prevent injection."""
    # Remove dangerous characters
    return re.sub(r'[<>\"\'&]', '', query)

# Use parameterized queries
# Never use string concatenation for SQL
```

### AWS Security
```hcl
# Use least privilege IAM policies
resource "aws_iam_policy" "ec2_policy" {
  policy = jsonencode({
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = [
          "s3:GetObject",  # Only specific actions needed
          "s3:PutObject"
        ]
        Resource = [
          aws_s3_bucket.logs.arn,
          "${aws_s3_bucket.logs.arn}/*"
        ]
      }
    ]
  })
}
```
