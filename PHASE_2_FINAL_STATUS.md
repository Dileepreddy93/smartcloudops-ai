## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

### OpenAI Integration Modernization
**Issue:** Outdated OpenAI API syntax (v0.x style)  
**Fix:** Updated to modern OpenAI v1+ client-based API

**Before:**
```python
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)
```

**After:**
```python
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(...)
```

### Testing Results ✅
```
✅ Flask app imported successfully
✅ Status: 200 - Phase: 2.2 - Basic GPT Integration (PDF Compliant)
