# 🔴 PHASE 3 KICKOFF - ML Anomaly Detection

## 📋 Phase 3 Overview
**Start Date:** August 4, 2024 (1 day ahead of schedule)  
**Planned Duration:** 1 day  
**Expected Completion:** August 5, 2024

## 🎯 Phase 3 Objectives (Per PDF Plan)

### 3.1 Data Preparation ⏳
- [ ] Set up data pipeline from Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Create CSV export functionality  
- [ ] Prepare training datasets for ML models

### 3.2 Model Training ⏳
- [ ] **Isolation Forest:** Outlier detection for system metrics
- [ ] **Prophet:** Time series forecasting for predictive monitoring
- [ ] Save trained models to `ml_models/anomaly_model.pkl`
- [ ] **Validation Target:** F1-score ≥ 0.85

### 3.3 Inference Pipeline ⏳
- [ ] Load model in production scripts
- [ ] **Input:** Live metrics from monitoring system
- [ ] **Output:** Anomaly status + severity scoring
- [ ] Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan

### Step 1: ML Environment Setup
```bash
# Install ML dependencies
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
pip install prophet  # For time series forecasting
pip install prometheus_client  # For metrics integration
```

### Step 2: Data Pipeline
```python
# scripts/data_preparation.py
- Prometheus metrics collector
- CSV export for training data
- Data preprocessing pipeline
```

### Step 3: Model Development
```python
# scripts/train_model.py
- Isolation Forest implementation
- Prophet time series model
- Model validation and testing
- Model persistence to pkl files
```

### Step 4: Inference Integration
```python
# scripts/anomaly_detection.py
- Real-time anomaly detection
- Severity scoring algorithm  
- Integration with monitoring alerts
```

## 📊 Expected Deliverables

### Files to Create/Update:
1. **scripts/data_preparation.py** - Data pipeline for ML training
2. **scripts/train_model.py** - ML model training pipeline (UPDATE)
3. **scripts/anomaly_detection.py** - Real-time inference engine
4. **ml_models/isolation_forest.pkl** - Trained outlier detection model
5. **ml_models/prophet_model.pkl** - Trained forecasting model
6. **requirements_ml.txt** - ML-specific dependencies

### Integration Points:
- Connect with existing Prometheus metrics
- Integrate with Flask ChatOps for anomaly alerts
- Link to auto-remediation triggers (Phase 4 prep)

## 🔄 Success Criteria

### Technical Validation:
- [ ] Models achieve F1-score ≥ 0.85 (PDF requirement)
- [ ] Real-time inference under 1 second response time
- [ ] Successful integration with existing monitoring

### Functional Testing:
- [ ] Detect CPU/Memory anomalies accurately
- [ ] Predict system failures 5-10 minutes in advance
- [ ] Generate meaningful severity scores (0-1 scale)

## 🚀 Next Phase Prep: Auto-Remediation (Phase 4)
- Prepare trigger logic for automated responses
- Design restart/scaling scripts
- Set up logging infrastructure for remediation actions
