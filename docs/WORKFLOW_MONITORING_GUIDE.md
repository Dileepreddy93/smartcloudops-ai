## üîß Auto-Fixing Capabilities

### Issues Automatically Fixed

1. **Code Formatting (Black)**
   - Detects: `would reformat` errors
   - Fix: Applies Black formatting to all Python files
   - Files: `app/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`

2. **Linting (Ruff)**
   - Detects: Linting errors and warnings
   - Fix: Applies auto-fixes with `--fix --unsafe-fixes`
   - Coverage: All Python files

3. **Type Checking (MyPy)**
   - Detects: Type annotation errors
   - Fix: Installs missing type stubs
   - Dependencies: `types-requests`, `types-PyYAML`

4. **Security (Bandit)**
   - Detects: High-severity security issues
   - Fix: Reports issues for manual review
   - Configuration: `--severity-level high`

5. **Test Failures (pytest)**
   - Detects: Failed test cases
   - Fix: Runs tests with verbose output for debugging
   - Coverage: All test files

## üìä Monitoring Workflows

### Workflow Status Types

- **‚úÖ SUCCESS**: All jobs completed successfully
- **‚ùå FAILED**: One or more jobs failed
- **üîÑ RUNNING**: Workflow is currently executing
- **‚è≥ QUEUED**: Workflow is waiting to start
- **‚èπÔ∏è CANCELLED**: Workflow was cancelled

### Common Failure Patterns

1. **Code Quality Issues**
   ```
   Black formatting issues detected
   Ruff linting errors found
   MyPy type checking errors
   ```

2. **Dependency Issues**
   ```
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openai'
   ImportError: cannot import name 'X'
   ```

3. **Test Failures**
   ```
   pytest FAILED
   AssertionError
   ```

4. **Security Issues**
   ```
   Bandit found X issues
   High severity security warnings
   ```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Monitoring
```bash
# Quick status check
./scripts/quick_status.sh

# Single monitoring run
python scripts/simple_workflow_monitor.py
```

### Continuous Monitoring
```bash
# Start continuous monitoring
python scripts/simple_workflow_monitor.py monitor

# Stop monitoring (Ctrl+C)
```

### Advanced Monitoring
```bash
# Detailed analysis
python scripts/auto_workflow_fixer.py

# Continuous advanced monitoring
python scripts/auto_workflow_fixer.py monitor
```

## üìà Monitoring Reports

### Generated Files

1. **`workflow_monitor.log`**
   - Detailed logging of all monitoring activities
   - Timestamps and error details

2. **`workflow_monitor_report.json`**
   - JSON report with statistics
   - Fixes applied and issues found

3. **Console Output**
   - Real-time status updates
   - Color-coded success/failure indicators

### Report Structure
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-26T14:53:30.953",
  "fixes_applied": ["black_formatting", "ruff_linting"],
  "issues_found": ["Type checking errors detected"],
  "summary": {
    "total_fixes": 2,
    "total_issues": 1,
    "success_rate": 0.67
  }
}
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Git Push Rejected**
   ```bash
   # Solution: Pull latest changes first
   git pull --rebase origin main
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Permission Denied**
   ```bash
   # Solution: Make scripts executable
   chmod +x scripts/*.py scripts/*.sh
   ```

3. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Solution: Install monitoring dependencies
   pip install -r scripts/requirements_monitor.txt
   ```

4. **API Rate Limits**
   - GitHub API has rate limits for unauthenticated requests
   - Consider using GitHub token for higher limits

### Manual Fixes

If auto-fixing fails, you can run fixes manually:

```bash
# Format code
black app/ scripts/ tests/

# Fix linting
ruff check app/ scripts/ tests/ --fix --unsafe-fixes

# Install type stubs
pip install types-requests types-PyYAML

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Security scan
bandit -r app/ --severity-level high
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. **Regular Monitoring**
- Run monitoring tools before pushing changes
- Use continuous monitoring for active development
- Check status after each workflow run

### 2. **Proactive Fixing**
- Fix issues locally before they reach CI/CD
- Use pre-commit hooks for automatic checks
- Maintain consistent code quality standards

### 3. **Documentation**
- Keep monitoring reports for analysis
- Document manual fixes for future reference
- Update this guide with new patterns

### 4. **Security**
- Review security scan results manually
- Don't auto-fix high-severity security issues
- Keep dependencies updated

## üìû Support

### Getting Help

1. **Check Logs**: Review `workflow_monitor.log` for detailed error information
2. **Manual Testing**: Run individual tools to isolate issues
3. **GitHub Issues**: Check workflow logs on GitHub for additional context

### Contributing

To improve the monitoring system:

1. Add new failure patterns to `analyze_failure()` method
2. Implement new fix methods for specific issues
3. Update this documentation with new features
4. Test thoroughly before deploying
