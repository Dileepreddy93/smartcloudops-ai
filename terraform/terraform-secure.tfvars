# ===== SECURITY NOTICE =====
# 
# This configuration implements network-level security by restricting access
# to specific IP addresses/ranges instead of allowing all internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0).
#
# Before applying this configuration:
# 1. Replace the example IP addresses with your actual authorized IPs
# 2. Use CIDR notation (e.g., 203.0.113.100/32 for single IP)
# 3. Test access after applying to ensure you're not locked out
# 4. Keep admin_ip_cidr updated with your current IP for emergency access
#
# Example IP sources to consider:
# - Your office/home IP addresses
# - VPN network ranges  
# - Monitoring system IPs
# - CI/CD pipeline IPs
# - Load balancer/proxy IPs
#
# Get your current IP: curl -s https://checkip.amazonaws.com/
